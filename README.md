# Dynamic Simulation of Seismic Resilient Structures with Uncertainty Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains part of the source code and documentation for my dissertation project at University College London (UCL), focused on the dynamic simulation of seismic resilient structures. The project investigates the effects of model and record-to-record uncertainties on the seismic response of Eccentrically Braced Frames (EBFs) with a particular emphasis on self-centering links.

## Project Description
The research integrates the principles of low-damage systems and the concept of damage-free self-centering links (SC-links) to enhance the resilience of steel structures subjected to seismic activity. By employing a damage-free SC-link design and accounting for uncertainties in future seismic designs, this project aims to push the boundaries of current engineering practices.

## Key Features
- OpenSees Simulation: Utilizes the OpenSees framework to conduct Modal Analysis and Non-linear Dynamic Analysis of EBFs.
- Monte Carlo Analysis: Implements Monte Carlo methods to address record-to-record uncertainties.
- Probabilistic Seismic Demand Model (PSDM): Employs PSDM and fragility tests to assess structural failure probabilities.
- Safety Coefficients Design: Develops new safety coefficients for the SC-links design based on simulation results.
